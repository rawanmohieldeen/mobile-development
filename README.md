My idea to create a stock market analysis and prediction app that analysis a historical data from khartoum stock exchange (historical stocks).

Before an investor invests in any stock, he needs to be aware of how the stock market

behaves and the factors that affected on the stock price. Investing in a good stock but at a bad

time can have unexpected results, while investment in a good stock at the right time can

brings profits, this is the basic problem which the investors must deal with.
