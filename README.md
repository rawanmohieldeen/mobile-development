Android Repo for Submitting Assignments

My Plan for this Semester is to create a Mobile **Tutor App** In Native Android using Android Studio And Java. 

Students need constant guidance for their studies. An on-demand tutor app will allow parents and children to find highly-qualified teachers from anywhere in the world for any subject.

They can choose the best teachers available in the list and talk to them personally via the app. In-app chat, voice call, or video call features will keep 
communication open between the students and the teachers.
